## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-friendly


### What I learned

I learned, after a lot of struggle, how to make the hamburguer menu with CSS only (my hand itched to use Javascript, lol). This was a good exercise for patience.

Discovered the "magic" of :has pseudo-class.

### Continued development

I'll definately need to study more on position 'absolute' and 'relative'.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell videos](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - The videos on ":has", "flexbox" and "grids" were very helpful for me to understand more deeply those concepts.
